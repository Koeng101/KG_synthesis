description: The first experiment to prove a new method of gene synthesis using restriction enzymes. 

# Conditions for experiment
supplies:
        # In units enzyme, as defined by NEB
        - SapI: 200
        - BbsI: 250
        - T4 ligase: 16000

assemblies:
        - Negative control
        - Positive control
        - GCC/CAG control 
        - 8 assemblies

variables: 
- DNA concentration in assembly:
        # Concentration of DNA in SapI assembly reaction, fmol
        - 10
        - 20
        - 40
        - 60
        - 100
- Enzyme concentration:
        # SapI concentration in reaction in units
        - 0
        - .1
        - .25
        - .5
        - 1
# In total, 325 conditions.

protocols:
        resuspension of primers:
                - Add 100uL of H2O to primer stocks
                - This creates 10pmol/uL stock solution
        annealing primers: 
                - Add 10uL primer stock (for and rev), 10uL Custmart, 70uL H2O
                - This creates a 1pmol/uL solution
